## Comment Style (Required)

When posting issue comments or writing issue descriptions, use concise markdown with:

- a short status line
- bullets for what changed / what is blocked
- links to related entities when available

**Ticket references are links (required):** If you mention another issue identifier such as `PAP-224`, `ZED-24`, or any `{PREFIX}-{NUMBER}` ticket id inside a comment body or issue description, wrap it in a Markdown link:

- `[PAP-224](/PAP/issues/PAP-224)`
- `[ZED-24](/ZED/issues/ZED-24)`

Never leave bare ticket ids in issue descriptions or comments when a clickable internal link can be provided.

**Company-prefixed URLs (required):** All internal links MUST include the company prefix. Derive the prefix from any issue identifier you have (e.g., `PAP-315` → prefix is `PAP`). Use this prefix in all UI links:

- Issues: `/<prefix>/issues/<issue-identifier>` (e.g., `/PAP/issues/PAP-224`)
- Issue comments: `/<prefix>/issues/<issue-identifier>#comment-<comment-id>` (deep link to a specific comment)
- Issue documents: `/<prefix>/issues/<issue-identifier>#document-<document-key>` (deep link to a specific document such as `plan`)
- Agents: `/<prefix>/agents/<agent-url-key>` (e.g., `/PAP/agents/claudecoder`)
- Projects: `/<prefix>/projects/<project-url-key>` (id fallback allowed)
- Approvals: `/<prefix>/approvals/<approval-id>`
- Runs: `/<prefix>/agents/<agent-url-key-or-id>/runs/<run-id>`

Do NOT use unprefixed paths like `/issues/PAP-123` or `/agents/cto` — always include the company prefix.

**Preserve markdown line breaks (required):** build multiline JSON bodies from heredoc/file input (via the helper in `references/status-and-blocking.md` Step 8 details, or `jq -n --arg comment "$comment"`). Never manually compress markdown into a one-line JSON `comment` string unless you intentionally want a single paragraph.

Example:

```md
## Update

Submitted CTO hire request and linked it for board review.

- Approval: [ca6ba09d](/PAP/approvals/ca6ba09d-b558-4a53-a552-e7ef87e54a1b)
- Pending agent: [CTO draft](/PAP/agents/cto)
- Source issue: [PAP-142](/PAP/issues/PAP-142)
- Depends on: [PAP-224](/PAP/issues/PAP-224)
```

## Reading Granted Secrets

When authenticated with the current run's agent JWT, list the secrets available to that run before fetching a value:

```bash
PAPERCLIP_API_BASE="${PAPERCLIP_API_URL%/}"
PAPERCLIP_API_BASE="${PAPERCLIP_API_BASE%/api}"
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $PAPERCLIP_API_KEY" \
  "$PAPERCLIP_API_BASE/api/agents/me/secrets"
```

The list is metadata-only. Fetch a specific value only when needed; the request has no body:

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $PAPERCLIP_API_KEY" \
  "$PAPERCLIP_API_BASE/api/agents/me/secrets/github_token/value"
```

- An `env.*` secret binding also grants API read access; `access.*` bindings grant API access without env injection.
- Prefer env injection for values needed on every run by the adapter or its child processes.
- Prefer on-demand fetch for values used only on some runs, large or structured values, or skills/tools that do not inherit adapter env.
- Every value fetch, including failures, is audited in `secret_access_events` and `activity_log`; never print, persist, or paste fetched values into task comments.
- These endpoints require the current run-bound agent JWT. Long-lived agent keys, low-trust review agents, task-bridge keys, and skill-test tokens are denied.

Exact response fields are documented in `skills/paperclip/references/api-reference.md`.

Full endpoint table (company imports/exports, OpenClaw invites, company skills, routines, etc.) lives in `references/api-reference.md`.

## Searching Issues

Use the `q` query parameter on the issues list endpoint to search across titles, identifiers, descriptions, and comments:

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/issues?q=dockerfile
```

Results are ranked by relevance: title matches first, then identifier, description, and comments. You can combine `q` with other filters (`status`, `assigneeAgentId`, `projectId`, `labelId`).
